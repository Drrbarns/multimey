      <h2>Our Return Process</h2>
      <p>We want you to love your purchase! If you're not satisfied, returns are easy.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Start Your Return</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the <a href="/returns">Returns Portal</a></li>
        <li>Enter your order number and email</li>
        <li>Select the items you want to return</li>
        <li>Choose a return reason</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Print Your Return Label</h3>
      <p>After submitting your return request, you'll receive a prepaid return label via email. Simply print it and attach it to your package.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Ship Your Return</h3>
      <p>Drop off your package at any authorized shipping location. You can find locations near you on our returns page.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Get Your Refund</h3>
      <p>Once we receive and inspect your return, we'll let you know if the refund was approved. If approved, you'll be refunded on your original payment method. Your bank or card company may take extra time to process it.</p>
      
      <h2>Return Policy Details</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You have 24 hours after receiving your item to request a return (faulty, damaged, or not what you requested only—no other reasons due to hygiene)</li>
        <li>Items must be unworn/unused, with tags, in original packaging; receipt or proof of purchase required</li>
        <li>Contact us first on WhatsApp ${contactPhone} or ${contactEmail}—returns sent without requesting first are not accepted</li>
        <li>No returns on custom/personalized items, personal care/beauty, sale items, or gift cards</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Exchange Instead?</h2>
      <p>Return the item first; once accepted, we'll do the exchange for the new item. You cannot request a different item than the one you purchased. See our <a href="/refund-policy">Refund Policy</a> for full details.</p>
